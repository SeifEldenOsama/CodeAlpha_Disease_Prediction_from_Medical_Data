I developed a Machine Learning model to predict the likelihood of diseases based on structured medical data. For this project, 
I specifically focused on Heart Attack Prediction using patient data (e.g., age, symptoms, blood test results).

Key Highlights:

Implemented multiple classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM.
Used performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to evaluate models.
Dataset: Heart Disease.
